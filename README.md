# Covid-19 Detection from X-rays with CNN & Pre-Trained Models Using Transfer Learning

## Introduction

This project focuses on the development of a machine learning model for detecting COVID-19 from X-ray images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and pre-trained models through transfer learning. As the COVID-19 pandemic has had a global impact, creating efficient classification systems is crucial for early detection and treatment. Our project leverages the power of CNN, which has been extensively investigated and proven effective in COVID-19 classification tasks.

## Data Description

The dataset used for this project is categorized into two main classes: COVID-19 Positive and Negative. The COVID-19 positive dataset contains 950 images, sourced from a publicly available collection on GitHub.
